Based off of "zuul-bad"project from Objects First with Java by David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

BlueJ is required to properly run.

To run: open the folder, open package.bluej
        right-click on ZuulApplet and click "void play()"
        you should then be loaded into the game.

You have to find your way to to your classroom before time runs out. This game is text-based, meaning
you can only move and execute commands by typing.
